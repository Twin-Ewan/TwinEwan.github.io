                        I created this animation over a span of a month, the idea was a 3D remake of my favourite game
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon" title="Please play it, like genuinely, download the rom I wont tell">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</a>
                        it was to have 4 major scenes,

                        <a href=Images/Beach&Sea.png title="Image">Stormy Sea, Beach at Dusk</a>,
                        <a href=Images/Montage&Forest.png title="Image">Montage (Which got scraped) & Treeshroud Forest</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I thought we'd get a few months to do all this but no, so I spent 2 weeks of non-stop working - literally, wake up, work on animation, go to bed,
                        repeat - In the end I had to remove 2 days of editing due copyright issues with the heavy use of pokemon *names* - but them looking like pokemon is perfectly fine?? -
                        which was... fun to get back. There's a few things I'd change - cheif among them the UVing - but for what it is, it's quite good

                    <p> I created this level using the Shooter Game template by Epic it was all made using blueprints so sadly no C++ yet</p>
                    <p>
                        I created all the models bar the trees & charaters and all the textures bar tree/character/terrain I learnt what

                        I created the original website over a span a day - with a few hours of breaks, naturally - and I really enjoyed it! granted the site was held
                        together duck-tape with the videos not working well when float'd left in a divider, granted that me be skill issue - the first time that phrase has
                        been said genuinely - but for a day's work in notepad and not having done HTML in literal years its quite well done
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size:9px"> I do much prefer this site though, even with it taking 3 attempts :P </p>

                    <p> I created a game for the my OOP Class, I choose the 2nd of 3 briefs, Side-Sidescroller Shooter, it took me around 1 week or so and im incredibly happy with it</p>
                    <p> I created 2 Models of Spaceships: Player & Spaceship, I also made 3 SFXs; Explosion, Shooting & Damage</p>

                        I made a proposal outlining every little detail: Software, Design Methodology, Colour palette (which, fun fact I reused for this site!), etc.
                        The original game was meant to be 2D endless runner but after a quick chat with one of my classmates compared it to
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustertruck" title="Article on the game">Clustertruck</a> and that gave me the idea to make it 3D...
                        with less than a hour I made it so and I think it's much better for it! Sadly with the changes some ideas had to be dropped... namely the whole
                        "Zombie Apocalypse" part of it... but thankfully we weren't graded on how well it adhered to the brief.
                    </p>

                    <p> I made this for my graded unit, We were to choose from 2 briefs: "Apocalypse" or "Time Travel" and I choose Apocalypse </p>
