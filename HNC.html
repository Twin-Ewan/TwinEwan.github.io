			<p> I've had this "Dream Game" of mine for years now, it's a very basic - and dare I say quaint - idea consising of a mobile & desktop board game app</p>
		
			<p> So when a class asked us to pitch a game i was already set, I made a 12 main pieces</p>

			<p>We were tasked to create a themed level for a FPS shooter based around 1 of 4 gamemodes... and then I did!

			<p>This was our big graded unit and teamworking game, we over did it in many a place - especially seeing this was meant to be made for 12yrs -
			I did about 60% (?) of the programning: Gun scripts, AI, Enemy Spawners, Game UI, Options Menu & Pause Menu (I fought so hard for that exit
			button you wouldn't believe it, and most everything else was Skylar, Lilly was meant to do stuff but was never given the chance sadly</p>

			<p> We did all this work and honestly, to me, it wasn't even fun in the end: the game play just boils down to "run backwards. shoot. run away again".
			I specify "to me" because during the playtest ours was by far the most loudly enjoyed by the children, so much so that I didn't actually get to have 
			my lunch break as I was begged to stay and let them play a little longer. At the end of the day one kid asked for a copy of the game to take home with them, 
			so I hastily wrote the GitHub link and they ran out shouting "I've got the game!"  In the end we came 3rd but I suspect that's mostly due to our game
		 	using keyboard and mouse which the children were quite unfamiliar with and as such they weren't able play it so well </p>
