		<h3> Heya, Welcome to my portfolio site! </h3>

		<p> I only made this site thanks to my portfolio class since most of the real important is already in my portfolio but alas requirements are required so this site was made</p>
		
		<p> This site is broken down into 3 parts following my education: <a href="HND.html" title="All my HND items (2023-2024)">HND</a>, <a href="HNC.html" title="All my HNC items (2022-2023)">HNC</a> & <a href="Highschool.html" title="All my Highschool items (2017-2022)">Highschool</a> though the last one is most ('20-'22) due to the lack of relevent classes</p>
