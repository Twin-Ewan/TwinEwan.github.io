			<p> I created this animation over a span of a month, the idea was a 3D remake of my favourite game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon" title="Please play it, like genuinely, download the rom I wont tell">Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon</a> it was to have 4 major scenes,

			<a href=HND/Images/Montage&Forest.png title="Image">Montage (Which got scraped) & Treeshroud Forest</a></p>
		
			<p> I created created 3 main Models: Mudkip, Cyndaquil & Groyvle</p>

			<img src="HND/Images/Grovyle.gif" alt="3D Grovyle Spinning" width="100" height="100">

			<p> I thought we'd get a few months to do all this but no, so I spent 2 weeks of non-stop working - literally, wake up, work on animation, go to bed -
			In the end I had to remove 2 days of editing due copyright issues with the heavy use of pokemon which was... fun.
			There's a few things I'd change - cheif among them the UVing - but for what it is, it's good</p>

			<p> I created this level using the Shooter Game template by Epic it was all made using blueprints so sadly no C++ yet</p>
			<p> I created all the models bar the trees & charaters and all the textures bar tree/character/terrain I learnt what 
			<a href="https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/advanced-rendering/triplanar-mapping/" title="Explation">Triplanar Mapping</a> was which will be
			mega handy for future projects</p>

			<p> A little meta, ey?</p>
			<p> I created this over a span a day - with a few hours of breaks, naturally - and I really enjoyed it! granted the site is held together
			duck-tape with the videos not working well when float'd left in a divider, granted that me be skill issue - the first time that phrase has 
			been said genuinely - but for a day's work in notepad and not having done HTML in literal years its quite well done... just don't do look
			closely at the code</p>
