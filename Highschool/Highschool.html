				<h4>To Steal from my GitHub wholesale:</h4>

				<p>
					The version first of this game was made in my free time on a old version of scratch installed on the school computers I got the idea for the
					game in a book after a while in my games dev class I need a game to make for my SCQF level 5 so I decided to reuse the game for that (mid late '19
					- early mid '21) <a href="Racers.html" target="_blank">The Original Scratch project</a> After a very
					turbulent start of not even having a game engine for months we were tasked once more to make another game so I started work on a 3d remake of the game
					there was one problem though, the engine the substitute teacher couldn't do 3D but thankfully after another 1.5 months~ I got to test out a better
					engine for the class Godot and it was leagues better so I continued on and started work on making the game, thankfully I used the small break to
					make the assets for the game on a online free editor 'figuro.io' so as you can expect they weren’t very good another problem also a raised;
					it was due sooner than I thought so by November I had to unforently abandon that project and had to quickly think of something else to make so I
					decided once more to do a port of the game to Godot thankfully as I had already made the game I already at the assets and the ones I couldn't reuse
					I’d remake so after 1-2 months of relaxed work it was done and thankfully up to spec as I was able to get Level 6 certificate by May.

					As told above this is what I was trying to make for my Higher game, I didn't get far but it was certianly a learning experiance, honestly my antics
					with Multiplayer and minimap is still a step futher than what I've done in Unity so far... even with that though it's was still bad

				<p>I made a whole bunch of models, only 3 of which will see the light of day: Bicycle, Golf Cart & Wagon</p>
